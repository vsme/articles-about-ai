                In the next couple of decades, we will be able to do things that
                would have seemed like magic to our grandparents.
              </p>
              <p>
                This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated.
                People have become dramatically more capable over time; we can
                already accomplish things now that our predecessors would have
                believed to be impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because
                we benefit from the infrastructure of society being way smarter
                and more capable than any one of us; in an important sense,
                society itself is a form of advanced intelligence. Our
                grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built
                and achieved great things. They contributed to the scaffolding
                of human progress that we all benefit from. AI will give people
                tools to solve hard problems and help us add new struts to that
                scaffolding that we couldn’t have figured out on our own. The
                story of progress will continue, and our children will be able
                to do things we can’t.
              </p>
              <p>
                It won’t happen all at once, but we’ll soon be able to work with
                AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without
                AI; eventually we can each have a personal AI team, full of
                virtual experts in different areas, working together to create
                almost anything we can imagine. Our children will have virtual
                tutors who can provide personalized instruction in any subject,
                in any language, and at whatever pace they need. We can imagine
                similar ideas for better healthcare, the ability to create any
                kind of software someone can imagine, and much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                With these new abilities, we can have shared prosperity to a
                degree that seems unimaginable today; in the future, everyone’s
                lives can be better than anyone’s life is now. Prosperity alone
                doesn’t necessarily make people happy – there are plenty of
                miserable rich people – but it would meaningfully improve the
                lives of people around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here is one narrow way to look at human history: after thousands
                of years of compounding scientific discovery and technological
                progress, we have figured out how to melt sand, add some
                impurities, arrange it with astonishing precision at
                extraordinarily tiny scale into computer chips, run energy
                through it, and end up with systems capable of creating
                increasingly capable artificial intelligence.
              </p>
              <p>
                This may turn out to be the most consequential fact about all of
                history so far. It is possible that we will have
                superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take
                longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.
              </p>
              <p>
                How did we get to the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity?
              </p>
              <p>In three words: deep learning worked.</p>
              <p>
                In 15 words: deep learning worked, got predictably better with
                scale, and we dedicated increasing resources to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s really it; humanity discovered an algorithm that could
                really, truly learn any distribution of data (or really, the
                underlying “rules” that produce any distribution of data). To a
                shocking degree of precision, the more compute and data
                available, the better it gets at helping people solve hard
                problems. I find that no matter how much time I spend thinking
                about this, I can never really internalize how consequential it
                is.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a lot of details we still have to figure out, but it’s
                a mistake to get distracted by any particular challenge. Deep
                learning works, and we will solve the remaining problems. We can
                say a lot of things about what may happen next, but the main one
                is that AI is going to get better with scale, and that will lead
                to meaningful improvements to the lives of people around the
                world.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI models will soon serve as autonomous personal assistants who
                carry out specific tasks on our behalf like coordinating medical
                care on your behalf. At some point further down the road, AI
                systems are going to get so good that they help us make better
                next-generation systems and make scientific progress across the
                board.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technology brought us from the Stone Age to the Agricultural Age
                and then to the Industrial Age. From here, the path to the
                Intelligence Age is paved with compute, energy, and human will.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we want to put AI into the hands of as many people as
                possible, we need to drive down the cost of compute and make it
                abundant (which requires lots of energy and chips). If we don’t
                build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource
                that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for
                rich people.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to act wisely but with conviction. The dawn of the
                Intelligence Age is a momentous development with very complex
                and extremely high-stakes challenges. It will not be an entirely
                positive story, but the upside is so tremendous that we owe it
                to ourselves, and the future, to figure out how to navigate the
                risks in front of us.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do
                it justice by trying to write about it now; a defining
                characteristic of the Intelligence Age will be massive
                prosperity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs –
                fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the
                discovery of all of physics – will eventually become
                commonplace. With nearly-limitless intelligence and abundant
                energy – the ability to generate great ideas, and the ability to
                make them happen – we can do quite a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be
                downsides, and we need to start working now to maximize AI’s
                benefits while minimizing its harms. As one example, we expect
                that this technology can cause a significant change in labor
                markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will
                change more slowly than most people think, and I have no fear
                that we’ll run out of things to do (even if they don’t look like
                “real jobs” to us today). People have an innate desire to create
                and to be useful to each other, and AI will allow us to amplify
                our own abilities like never before. As a society, we will be
                back in an expanding world, and we can again focus on playing
                positive-sum games.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling
                wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is
                looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter. If a
                lamplighter could see the world today, he would think the
                prosperity all around him was unimaginable. And if we could
                fast-forward a hundred years from today, the prosperity all
                around us would feel just as unimaginable.
